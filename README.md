# Yith Library Responsive Web Client

A modern client for both mobile and desktop devices.

Server code: https://github.com/lorenzogil/yith-library-server

This web client lets the user access to his passwords and secrets, safely
stored at the Yith Library server. View, editing and deleting are supported.

There is an instance running at http://yithlibrary.com/

## Development

This application is built with [Ember CLI](http://ember-cli.com/), so you'll
need it installed and working before modifying anything.

You can run a development server with:

    $ ember server -p 4400

The `-p 4400` options is to make it serve the application in that port. That is
not required, but it's the default development configuration in the Yith
Library server for CORS.

You can build the whole thing with:

    $ ember build -p

That will generate the production files and will allow you to make your own
deployment.

You can find more details about how to use Ember CLI in their
[documentation](http://ember-cli.com/user-guide/).
